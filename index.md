Hello and welcome to my blog! I’m Jalal Choker, a software engineer and a computer scientist.

I’ve learned a lot over the years about programming, systems, languages, software design and algorithms.

My interests are:
* [Distributed Systems](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/distributed-systems.html) especially scalability, security and fault tolerance in [blockchains](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/blockchain).
* [Cryptography](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/cryptography): The practice of developing and using coded algorithms to protect and obscure transmitted information so that it may only be read by those with the permission and ability to decrypt it.
* [Software Design](https://martinfowler.com/architecture/): The shared understanding that the expert developers have of the system design. The decisions one wishes to get right early in a project.
* [Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition/): A good algorithm is fundamental to efficient programs and good software design. Knowing the space–time trade-off and the data structures to choose among is required for being an exemplary programmer. 

I received a master's degree from the [Department of Computer Science at Loughborough University, UK](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/) and a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the [Department of Computer Engineering at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad](http://ce.um.ac.ir/index.php?lang=en).

This is my personal blog. I write about pretty much everything that I care about. I hope you finding it interesting and helpful. If you have a question, you can contact me directly, try emailing jalal.choker@gmail.com..
