Hello and welcome to my blog! I’m Jalal Choker, a software engineer with 15+ years of programming experience.

I’ve learned a lot over the years about programming, systems, languages, software design and algorithms.

My interests are:
* [Distributed Systems](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/distributed-systems.html) especially scalability, security and fault tolerance in [blockchains](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/blockchain).
* [High-Level Languages](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/topics/programming_languages) languages with strong abstraction from the details of the computer, the amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a language is.
* [Algorithm Design](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition/) A good algorithm is fundamental to efficient programs and good software design. Knowing the space–time trade-off and the data structures to choose among is required for being an exemplary programmer. 

I received a master's degree from the [Department of Computer Science at Loughborough University, UK](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/compsci/) and a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the [Department of Computer Engineering at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad](http://ce.um.ac.ir/index.php?lang=en).

This is my personal blog. I write about pretty much everything that I care about. I hope you finding it interesting and helpful. If you have a question, you can contact me directly, try emailing jalal.choker@gmail.com..
