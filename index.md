Hello and welcome to my blog! I’m Jalal Choker, a software engineer with 15+ years of programming experience.

I’ve learned a lot over the years about programming languages and fielded a lot of questions about C#, Java and other programming languages.

My interests are:
* [High-Level Languages](https://isaaccomputerscience.org/topics/programming_languages) languages with strong abstraction from the details of the computer, the amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a language is.
* [Algorithm Design](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition/) A good algorithm is fundamental to efficient programs and good software design. Knowing the space–time trade-off and the data structures to choose among is required for being an exemplary programmer. 

I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Department of Computer Engineering at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad](http://en.um.ac.ir/content/Department-of-Computer-Engineering).

This is my personal blog. I write about pretty much everything that I care about. I hope you finding it interesting and helpful. If you have a question, you can contact me directly, try emailing jalal.choker@gmail.com..
